        <p class="aboutp">Java Juice Café started with a simple idea: two college friends blending coffee and fresh juice in their garage, trying to stay awake through finals while staying healthy. One rainy afternoon, they mixed cold brew with orange juice—just for fun—and accidentally created their first signature drink. That quirky combo sparked a mission: to craft energizing, wholesome beverages that surprise and delight. Today, Java Juice Café is a cozy corner where creativity meets community, and every drink tells a story.</p>
